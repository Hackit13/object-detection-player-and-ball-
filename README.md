# object-detection-player-and-ball-
I first of all collected some photos that had players and balls in it, annotated them using Roboflow tool, created a labelled dataset out of it and split it into test, train and validation data sets. Then I used YOLOv8 model for the object detection task. Object detection using models like YOLOv8 is a popular approach for tasks like ball and player detection in sports analytics. YOLOv8 is an updated version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, known for its real-time performance and accuracy.
